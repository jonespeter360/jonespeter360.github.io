I'm just this guy, you know? I wanted to enter into the heady
space of internet blogging because I wanted to enter into 
the great "conversation": meaning theology, philsophy, science. You 
know, super chill stuff. 

Not because I'm any great shakes at any of those three things: my training
has been more scientific than any of those three, and in many ways
I'm just your average aerospace engineer (meaning that I'm crazy 
for all things space, this is my [favorite nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula).
I'm a great lover of science, and a great lover of Jesus, though I make no pretense
to be an expert in either. I love science, because "by nature all men have a
desire to know," \([two guesses who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle))\). 
But I write as a lover of it, not as a doctor of it (though I might get that 
someday too). And pretending to be an expert in Jesus would be the height
of arrogance: who could pin down the living God? [Who has defined Him and
pinned him down](https://biblehub.com/romans/11-34.htm)?


So you'll find all kinds of content on this blog: updates on my coding 
projects I'm doing in my spare time, blog posts that maybe I'll turn
into a book one day. This is mostly an outgrowth of my journaling and
writing that I'm doing all the time anyway. Since I find myself filing 
my spare time with writing essays and learning more math **for fun**
I figured I'd better at least put my scribbles out there for the world, 
in the hopes that someone might gain something from it.
